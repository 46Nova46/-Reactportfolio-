          After getting my Associate degree I went on to complete my Bachelors degree in computer engineering technology. The program gave me a much deeper dive into some of the areas I had touched on while completing my associates. The things I learned helped me succeed during my time working in the lab and in helping me develop the several projects I have made away from the classroom.
